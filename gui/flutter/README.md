# Flutter GUI

All the Flutter bits to make it happen.

flutter-git-gui

- Git Gui that works with github and can easily be made to work with Gitea
- Just uses nice and simple HTTP calls to the Git Server.


flutter_i18n_complete

- A scaffold for a standard Flutter Mobile and Desktop app that properly does i18n.
- Does not have any l10n

- Will need this.
